A simple OBD2 ELM327 Swift project


A simple OBD2 stat/diagnostics Swift project, that is intended to work with ELM327 Bluetooth obd2 adapters. 
The general idea is to have a dashboard with realtime statistics showing, as in engine rpm, fuel consumption, airflow etc. 
Additionally would like be able to run a fault code check that would specifically work with japanese import vehicles, but that
may be out of the scope of this project.
